# EEG-deidentification-
This repository details the code used to deidentify EEG files using MNE and python.

The code requires that you download python prior to installing MNE. You can use various Integrated Development Environments to run MNE such as Spyder, Pycharm and Vs Code (I preferred to use Spyder)  

You can install MNE here: https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html
